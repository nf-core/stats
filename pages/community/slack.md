Slack is a real-time messaging tool, with discussion split into channels and groups. We use it to provide help to people running nf-core pipelines, as well as discussing development ideas. You can join the nf-core slack by getting an invite [here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack).

```sql view_days
select
    timestamp
from slack_users
group by 1
```

<DateRange
    name=range_filtering_a_query
    data={view_days}
    dates=timestamp
    defaultValue="All Time"
/>

```users_long_filtered
select * from nfcore_db.slack_users
where timestamp between '${inputs.range_filtering_a_query.start}' and '${inputs.range_filtering_a_query.end}'
