Slack is a real-time messaging tool, with discussion split into channels and groups. We use it to provide help to people running nf-core pipelines, as well as discussing development ideas. You can join the nf-core slack by getting an invite [here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack).

```sql view_days

```users_long_filtered

where timestamp between '${inputs.range_filtering_a_query.start}' and ('${inputs.range_filtering_a_query.end}'::date + interval '1 day')
order by 1 desc
