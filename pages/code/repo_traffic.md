Every time a nextflow user pulls an nf-core pipeline, the repository is cloned. Here we can track how much that happens across all nf-core repositories. Please note that these numbers come with some caveats [ see more ].

Additionally, GitHub tracks how many times people view repository web pages on github.com.
