title: Pipeline Development Timeline
sidebar_position: 6
---

This timeline shows when each nf-core pipeline was in development and when they had their **first release**. It helps answer whether old pipelines are finally being released or if there are a lot of quick-fire pipelines being added and released quickly.

> **Note**: This analysis tracks time to **first release**, not the most recent release, to better understand the development lifecycle of each pipeline.

## Pipeline Lifecycle Timeline

Each pipeline's lifecycle is visualized with three complementary bar charts:
- **ðŸ“Š Total Timeline**: Complete tracked time from repository creation to today
- **ðŸ”¨ Development Period**: Time from initial commit to **first release** 
- **ðŸš€ Post-Release Period**: Time since **first release** (ongoing development)

```sql lifecycle_summary
-- Show complete lifecycle for each pipeline with bar chart data
-- Now showing time to FIRST release, not last release
SELECT 
    pipeline_name,
    development_start::DATE as start_date,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'Released' AND development_end IS NOT NULL 
        THEN STRFTIME(development_end::DATE, '%b %Y')
        ELSE 'â€”'
    END as first_release_date,
    status,
    -- Add grouping columns
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM development_start) as start_year,
    development_days,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'Released' AND development_end IS NOT NULL 
        THEN DATE_DIFF('day', development_end, CURRENT_DATE)
        ELSE 0
    END as days_since_first_release,
    CASE

## Development vs Released Time Analysis

```sql duration_stats
-- Calculate statistics about development vs time since first release
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as pipeline_count,
    ROUND(AVG(development_days), 0) as avg_development_days,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN DATE_DIFF('day', development_end, CURRENT_DATE) END), 0) as avg_days_since_first_release,
    ROUND(MEDIAN(development_days), 0) as median_development_days,
    MIN(development_days) as min_development_days,
    MAX(development_days) as max_development_days,
    -- Note: total_releases temporarily removed due to query issues
FROM nfcore_db.pipeline_timeline
WHERE development_start >= '2018-01-01'
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY avg_development_days DESC
```

```sql quick_vs_slow
-- Categorize pipelines by development speed

    CASE 
        WHEN development_days <= 180 THEN 'Quick (â‰¤6 months)'
        WHEN development_days <= 365 THEN 'Medium (6-12 months)'

## Year-over-Year Analysis

```sql yearly_analysis
-- Analysis by start year to see trends - IMPROVED VERSION

    DATE_TRUNC('year', MAKE_DATE(CAST(start_year AS INTEGER), 1, 1)) as start_year,

    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN 1 END) as pipelines_released,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status != 'Released' THEN 1 END) as pipelines_in_development,
    -- Only calculate averages for pipelines that have been released to avoid skewing data
    CAST(ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN development_days END), 0) AS INTEGER) as avg_development_days_released,
    -- Show average for all pipelines (including in-development) for comparison
    CAST(ROUND(AVG(development_days), 0) AS INTEGER) as avg_development_days_all,
    -- Calculate median for better central tendency
    CAST(ROUND(MEDIAN(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN development_days END), 0) AS INTEGER) as median_development_days_released,
    -- Calculate release rate as a percentage of total pipelines
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN 1 END)/ COUNT(*), 1) as release_rate_percent,
    -- Add min/max for context
    MIN(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN development_days END) as min_dev_days_released,
    MAX(CASE WHEN status = 'Released' THEN development_days END) as max_dev_days_released,
    -- Filter out incomplete recent years for more accurate trending
    CASE 
        WHEN start_year >= 2024 THEN 'Recent (Incomplete)'
        WHEN start_year >= 2020 THEN 'Recent'

  AND start_year <= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) -- Don't include future years
GROUP BY start_year
ORDER BY start_year
```

### Development Time Trends

<Note>
Recent years (2024+) show lower average days until first release because many pipelines are still in development. The chart below shows trends for **released pipelines only** to avoid this bias.

## Development Start vs Duration Analysis

```sql scatter_data
-- Scatter plot data showing start vs duration
SELECT 
    development_start,
    development_days,
    status,
    pipeline_name,
    start_year
FROM nfcore_db.pipeline_timeline

    legend=true
/>

<Alert status="warning">
This analysis focuses on <strong>first release</strong> rather than most recent release to better understand the initial development effort required for each pipeline. 
Pipelines with many total releases indicate active ongoing development after the initial release.
