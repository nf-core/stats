Since backticks have special meaning in YAML, values in `meltano.yml` should be wrapped in double quotes.\n- `columns`: Array of column names to select. Using `[\"*\"]` is not recommended as it can become very expensive for a table with a large number of columns.\n- `datetime_key`: Name of datetime column to use as [replication key](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#replication-key).\n- `filters`: Optional array of `WHERE` clauses to filter extracted data, e.g. `\"column='value'\"`.\n"
